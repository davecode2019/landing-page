### Initial Project Overview

Using HTML and CSS I will be recreating the following landing page:

Part of The Odin Projects Foundations curriculum.

### Final thoughts

This task taught me a lot about the importance of clear structure to the HTML and most importantly the CSS.

I'm happy with the way it turned out and the approach of tackling the task piece by piece made everything less overwhelming. The mini victory of getting each section complete and working how I wanted also motivated me to carry on with the next. I ended up snowballing and getting the whole thing done in a few hour during work breaks.
